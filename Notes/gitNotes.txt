# development flow:

pull changes from remote -> make changes (on local machine) -> add -> commit -> push

commands:

git pull                                # make sure you're up to date locally

(make changes)

git add -A                              # -A implies add all changes
git commit -m "(description of commit)" # describes what you've done
git push origin master                  # pushes to remote (i.e., github cloud)
