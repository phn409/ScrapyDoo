INSTALL
go to https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
alternatively, google mysql

Download mysql-installer-web-community-8.0.17.0

Run wizard. I had to do custom install to choose the correct Python distribution, otherwise it wouldn't let me install the connector.


follow wizard instructions, I chose all default options.

NEW DATABASES

option 1:
from MySQL command line

CREATE DATABASE (your database);

option 2:
from sqlalchemy. This seems like something sqlalchemy wasn't really meant to do, so it's just a workaround.

import sqlalchemy as sqal

# first create an engine (must link to existing database):
engine=sqal.create_engine('mysql+mysqlconnector:'
			  '//USERNAME:PASSWORD'
			  '@SERVER IP/DATABASE NAME')
# where username and password are (for now) root & sqlPASSWORD. The server IP, for a local host, is 127.0.0.1.

# then get the underlying engine:
con=engine.connect()

# commit the connection?
con.execute('commit')

# pass the MySQL command to create a new database
con.execute('CREATE DATABASE new_db_name')

# replace new_db_name with your new database

option 3:
from the graphical interface (MySQL Workbench)

-> chooose MySQL Workbench from windows menu
-> connect to database (under database tab)
-> use "create new schema" button and name database
